This is a port of the Jacchia 77 atmospheric model to Python
It is based off of the Fortran version from
http://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/atmospheric/jacchia/jacchia-77/

Instead of accessing global variables, the function returns a vector containing
Altitude
Temperature
The number densities of...
	N2
	O2
	O
	Ar
	he
	H
Mass of all above
Molecular weight

To use, simply include the j77sri.py file and call the function j77sri with the  max 
altitude and exospheric temperature (Tinf), and it will return the values listed above
